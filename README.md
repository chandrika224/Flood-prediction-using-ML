Overview:
This project focuses on predicting flood occurrences using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze environmental and historical flood-related data, preprocess it, and build predictive models that can assist in disaster management and early warning systems.

 Tech Stack:
â€¢	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
â€¢	Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
â€¢	Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

 Project Structure:
Flood-Prediction-ML/
â”œâ”€â”€ Flood_Prediction.ipynb   # Main Jupyter/Colab notebook
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                    # Flood datasets (CSV, Excel)
â”œâ”€â”€ images/                  # Visualizations & charts
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/                 # Project documentation (PDF/DOCX)
â””â”€â”€ README.md                # Documentation file

Key Steps:
â€¢	Data Collection & Cleaning â€“ Imported flood-related datasets and handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
â€¢	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Studied rainfall, water levels, and historical flood patterns. Created visualizations to identify correlations.
â€¢	Feature Engineering â€“ Encoded categorical values, normalized numerical features, and prepared datasets for ML models.
â€¢	Model Building â€“ Applied ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict flood likelihood.
â€¢	Evaluation â€“ Measured performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
â€¢	Results & Insights â€“ Highlighted environmental factors most strongly correlated with flood events.


Results:
â€¢	Achieved [Insert accuracy, e.g., 89%] accuracy with Random Forest classifier.
â€¢	Found rainfall intensity and water level to be strong predictors of flood risk.
â€¢	Model can be used as a decision-support tool for flood risk management.

 How to Run:
1.	Clone the repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/your-username/flood-prediction-ml.git
3.	Open the notebook:
4.	jupyter notebook Flood_Prediction.ipynb
or upload it to Google Colab.
5.	Install dependencies:
6.	pip install -r requirements.txt
7.	Run all cells sequentially.

Future Work:
â€¢	Use deep learning methods (LSTM, RNN) for time-series flood prediction.
â€¢	Deploy the model as a web or mobile app for real-time predictions.
â€¢	Integrate with live weather API data for continuous monitoring.
